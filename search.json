We integrate a longitudinal sampling of\nkillifish genetic with a We measure fish growth, dietary preferences,\nreproductive capacity, predators, sex ratio, etc. We study aging in\nkillifish in the wild, analyzing their molecular, cellular, tissue/organ\nmarkers of aging. An example of the aging biomarkers we can analyze in\nwild killifish includes the following:\nIn our field research, we ask the following questions: 1. How does\nmortality vary as a function of age in wild killifish? 2. What are the\nmost frequent aging biomarkers associated with advanced age in wild\nkillifish?\nAnnual killifish have unique adaptations that allow them to survive\nin an extremely harsh environment, where water evaporates for the\nlargest part of the year.\nInstead of having drought-resistant adults - like in the case of several\namphibians and lungfish - annual killifish adopt a strategy that is more\nsimilar to what invertebrates and plants do: their embryos undergo a\ndevelopmentally arrested state (called diapause), which enables them to\nsurvive up to years without hatching in the dry soil.\nAnnual killifish live in environments where precipitations occur\nseasonally, and seasonal water is required for embryos to hatch. Due to\nthe\nWe study killifish in their natural environment in the Gonarezhou National Park in\nZimbabwe.\nWe explore the ecological and evolutionary factors that influence the\nunique phenotypes characteristic of wild killifish populations, such as\nembryonic diapause, explosive sexual maturation and limited adult\nlifespan.\nWe study the establishment and maintenance of killifish-specific\nmicrobial communities in the gut, skin and gills, and how these\ncontribute to killifish fitness.\nWe are broadly interested in gaining an integrated understanding of\nkillifish biology in the context of its ecological network.\nTo study killifish ecology and genetics in the field, we use a\ncombination of methods, including killifish genomics, as well as\nsequencing the genomes of the microbes that co-exist with killifish. We\nare interested in applying environmental DNA (eDNA) technologies to the\nstudy of killifish ecology.\nOur fieldwork strongly depends on our network of precious collaborators\nand on the continuous support from the Gonarezhou Conservation Trust,\nthe Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority, the Research\nCouncil of Zimbabwe and the University of Zimbabwe.\nPopulation genetics in wild killifish\nWork done in our group has helped shed light on how demographic\nconstraints, such as population bottlenecks, shaped the evolution of\nkillifish life history.

We explore how genetics and ecology\naffect aging at individual level.\nThe why of aging: We study the evolutionary\ncauses underlying lifespan and aging phenotypes of species in\nnature. We explore how natural selection and neutral evolution\ncontribute to the emergence of genetic variants causing long or short lifespan, slow or\nrapid aging.\nOur work is highly multi-disciplinary and we use a combination of\napproaches, including molecular biology, comparative genomics,\npopulation genetics, computer simulations and experimental\ninterventions.\nMicrobiome and aging\nWe explore the complex host-microbiome crosstalk during aging. We study\nwhether and how hosts select their own microbiome community and how the\nmicrobiome, in turn, affects host phenotypes, including defense from\npathogens, aging and lifespan. We ask\nwhether commensal microbial taxa evolve into novel strains in the\ntimescale of host aging and whether microbial evolution in turn\nexacerbates systemic aging and pathology.\nImmune system\nWe are interested in the evolution\nof the adaptive immune system among closely-related killifish\nspecies in relation to the gain or loss of specific antibody classes,\nsuch as the fish “mucosal” IgZ/T. We study aging in the immune system,\nwith a focus on clonal B cell\ndiversity and on the impact of somatic mutations on B cell function.\nWe investigate the role of adaptive immunity in the establishment of\nhost-specific commensal microbial consortia and we study how aging of\nthe immune system affects age-dependent shifts in microbiome\ncomposition.\nAfrican killifish\nOur lab builds tools\nand protocols\nthat help establish African killifish as a model\nof vertebrate aging, to fill the gap between experimentally short-lived\ninvertebrates, such as C. elegans and Drosophila, and\nlonger-lived vertebrate model organisms, such as mice and naked\nmole-rats.\nBy studying killifish, we seek to understand the molecular, cellular and\nphysiological changes that occur during aging in vertebrates. We are\nbroadly interested in the genomic basis for species-specific adaptations\nin killifish and we investigate the evolutionary basis for the natural\ndiversity of adult lifespan across species within this group of fish. To\nexplore phenotype and genome evolution in killifish, we sequenced and\nassembled several killifish genomes, available for anyone to browse on\nour killifish genome\nbrowser.\n\n\n\nOur main model system for experimental and field work is the African\nturquoise killifish (Nothobranchius furzeri),\nthe shortest-lived vertebrate species bred in captivity. Turquoise\nkillifish are naturally short-lived and recapitulate several aspects of\nhuman aging, including cancer, inflammation and dysbiosis.\nField research\nWe conduct field research in the Gonarezhou National Park in Zimbabwe,\nwhich hosts natural populations of turquoise killifish.\n\n\n\nWe study killifish in their natural habitat, mapping their\ndistribution, ecology, demography and population genetics.\n\n\n\n",
